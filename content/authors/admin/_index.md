**Shuo Meng** is a PhD candidate of Biomedical Engineering at City University of Hong Kong. He aims to solve the practical engineering problems. For example, he leads the [“fabric recognition” project (”织识“)](https://www.jntex.cn/), which is using in the actural production and is highly praised. 

Although his major is not computer science, he studied it systematically out of a strong passion. He used deep learning and other computer technologies to solve problems in Textile area, such as ```fabric defect detection, fabric smoothness evaluation, fabric images style transfer, fabric simulation, etc ```.  

**Shuo Meng** is now working for medical signal processing under <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/bme/jinliahu/"> Prof. Hu Jinlian</a>.
